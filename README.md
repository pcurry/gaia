overall purpose: parsing ESA Gaia data into 3D sector maps for sci-fi purposes

required libraries / extensions:
- AstroPy
- SciPy
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Pandas

** file: Iota_Pegasi_Sector.py **

current functionality:
- prototype of sector maps that will be mass-generated by this project

** file: Gaia_Query.py **

current functionality:
- query Gaia dataset by pre-set parallax cut-off for stars within set distance of Sol - get approx 5K stars with Gaia DR3 designation, gal-lon, gal-lat and parallax (as measured by Gaia space telescope)
- ingests into a Panda dataframe
- adds sampling of additional stars (e.g. Alpha Centauri, Vega), which are too bright to be in the Gaia dataset
- calculates distance from Sol in parsecs (from Gaia-measured parallax), adds as column to Panda dataframe
- calculates x,y,z coordinates (with Sol as the origin, X-axis as Coreward/Rimward, Y-axis as Spinward/Trailing, Z-axis as Galactic North/South) in parsecs from Gaia-measured G-lon and G-lat, adds as column to Panda dataframe
- inserts Sol as special case (e.g. also a star too bright to be detected by Gaia, and by definition has no parallax)
- prints panda dataframe

punch list / road map for continued development:
- add G-Flux to parameters downloaded from Gaia
- user prompted for distance from Sol to be sampled from Gaia
- complete scrub of stars too bright to appear in Gaia - put in .csv file (including gal-lat, gal-lon, parallax, G-Flux)
- ingest bright_stars as .csv file into panda data frame
- ingest .csv file of stars which appeared in Gaia DR1 and/or DR2 but not in DR3 (including gal-lat, gal-lon, parallax, G-Flux)
- calculates normalized brightness of stars based on G-Flux and distance (note this is not the same as absolute magntiude / luminosity, but close enough to work as a proxy for our purposes), add as column to Panda data frame
- query SIMBAD to cross-match Gaia designations with Star Names and Spectral Classifications, add as columns to Panda data frame
- include handling of when SIMBAD has no cross-matched entries
- include handling of when SIMBAD has cross-match but no spectral type
- convert SIMBAD rendering of Bayer and Flamsteed designations to more human-friendly text
- exports final panda dataframe as a .csv file
 
** separate script to be written **

- ingests .csv file into 10 parsec x 10 parsec x 10 parsec cubes
- create 3D plots as "sector maps" (Iota_Pegasi_Sector.py being a prototype)
- color of markers to be keyed to spectral type (OBAFGKM) of star
- size of markers to be keyed to the brightness of the star
- markers to be labeled by star name
- output: labeled 3D sector maps, labeled 2D sector maps, gazetteer table of stars in the sector (formated in Textile)
